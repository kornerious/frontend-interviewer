Mastery of these concepts is crucial for understanding JavaScript's behavior, especially in browser environments, and for debugging common issues.",

This topic directly builds upon the knowledge of the call stack and execution context to explain how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations (like timers, network requests, and user events) in a non-blocking manner. It is a more advanced concept requiring a prior grasp of the synchronous execution model."
