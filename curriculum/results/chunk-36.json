The prompt stated that each of the 3 content items (implied indexes 67-69, with IDs: e14fd79b-957c-45c4-bdee-5719d6a3687d, 3a25c798-a73d-4e5f-a7d8-25481a1caaf2, b527fff4-a1d1-449f-88cb-b9696f82b8d6) would include 'type', 'title', 'tags', 'technology', 'prerequisites', 'complexity', 'interviewRelevance', 'interviewFrequency', and 'learningPath'. However, the provided items only contained their 'id' field. Additionally, the required 'index' field for the output items was not present in the input. Without this critical information (especially 'prerequisites', 'title', 'tags', and 'complexity'), it is impossible to perform the requested curriculum design tasks. Therefore, no thematic clusters or learning sequences can be generated.",
