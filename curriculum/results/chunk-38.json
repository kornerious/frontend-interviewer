          "reason": "Building directly on the basic Event Loop understanding, this item delves into the more nuanced distinction and execution order of microtasks (e.g., Promises) and macrotasks (e.g., setTimeout). This advanced detail is critical for accurate prediction of complex asynchronous behavior and is a prerequisite for a thorough interview explanation."

It serves as an application and synthesis of knowledge gained from the previous two items."
