          "reason": "This item, conceptualized as 'JavaScript Execution Context and Call Stack', is foundational. Understanding how JavaScript code is processed, the role of the global and function execution contexts, and the call stack is essential before delving into more nuanced topics. It provides the basic mental model for JavaScript's runtime behavior."

          "reason": "This item, conceptualized as 'Understanding JavaScript Closures', directly builds upon the concepts of execution context and lexical scope. Closures are a powerful feature derived from how JavaScript handles function environments, making this a natural progression once the student understands the underlying execution model."
