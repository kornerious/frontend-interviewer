These are the primary tools and patterns used to write asynchronous code, which relies on the Event Loop for execution. Understanding the underlying mechanism first makes these concepts much clearer."

It serves as an excellent test of the concepts learned in the previous items, particularly the nuances of Promise behavior and concurrency."
