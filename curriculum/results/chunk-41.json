This is fundamental for modern web development, dealing with network requests and non-blocking operations. It should be understood before delving into the Event Loop, as it provides the practical context for asynchronous operations."

It is a more advanced topic that builds directly upon a solid understanding of asynchronous concepts (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await), making it a natural progression after 'Asynchronous JavaScript'."
